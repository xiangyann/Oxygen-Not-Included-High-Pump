# Oxygen Not Included High Pump mod

This is the archival releases for High Pump mod in ONI, since some people might liked a previous release better (for instance 0.1.X instead of 0.2.X)
And also new features might introduce new bugs.

Notable Changes:
0.1.x - Original implementation
0.2.x - Modernized codebase with edge case handling
0.3.x - Added a Filtered High Pump for specific gas pumping
